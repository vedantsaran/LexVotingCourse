                This course was developed by a Lexington High School student with insights from teachers, aiming to educate peers on the mechanics of voting and civic engagement.

            <h2>Why This Course?</h2>
            <p>
                While Lexington High School offers an excellent history curriculum, there is currently no class dedicated to teaching students about the practical aspects of voting and engaging in civic processes. This one-semester course proposal aims to fill that gap by providing students with:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>An understanding of how voting works in practice.</li>
                <li>Knowledge about voter registration and participation.</li>
                <li>Opportunities to engage in mock elections and civic activities.</li>
                <li>The tools to become informed and active citizens.</li>
            </ul>
